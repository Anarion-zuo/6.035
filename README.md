Hello! Welcome to the Java Skeleton REPO.

You will need to modify Main.java, Decafscanner, DecafParser and Token as you see fit. This is just a minimal suggestion for your project's organization. Feel free to change and/or add any files. Ultimately, the only constraint is that the `run.sh` and `build.sh` correctly run your compiler.

Happy parsing!
